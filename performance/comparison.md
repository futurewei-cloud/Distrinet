# Introduction

This file shows comparisons between Distrinet and Distrinet after docker replacement, which we call as "Docker-based Distrinet". We compare these two tools from 3 aspects, performance, scale and time.

# Performance Comparison

We tested the performances of these examples: a linear topology with 6 hosts and 6 switches; a binary tree whose depth is 3; customized topology.

We care about these metrics: the connection of the topology and the bandwidth of iperf.

"Pingall and links" are metrics to test the connection of the topology.

"Worker containers" part shows lxc/docker containers created in worker host.

"Iperf" is used to test the bandwidth.

## Linear topology (6 hosts,6 switches)

There are 6 hosts and 6 switches in the topology.

## Conclusion

These tests show that Docker-based Distrinet can establish all kinds of connected topology. Besides, we illustrate iperf performance as follows. However, the iperf performance of Docker-based Distrinet is worse for some reason.

- Linear topology:

- Binary tree topology:

- Customized topology:

# Scale Comparison

We test **the maximum scale of linear topology** that two tools can support. It shows that after the docker replacement, we can establish much larger scale than before.

## LXC-based Distrinet: between 90 and 99

90 hosts and 90 switches can be established.

![](./img/lxd/90.png)

However, when establishing 99 hosts and 99 switches, this error occurred.

![](./img/lxd/99.png)

## docker container: at least 400

300 hosts and 300 switches can be established.

![](./img/docker/300start.png)

400 hosts and 400 switches can be established. However, some packages are lost.

# Time Comparison

Otherwise, we added a new module to test the time to establish and stop the topology. And we noticed that after the docker replacement, time performance is better.

We show average start/stop time in the chart and figure below.

For example, we notice that with the expansion of linear topology's scale, LXC-based Distrinet need much more time to establish the topology than Docker-based Distrinet.
